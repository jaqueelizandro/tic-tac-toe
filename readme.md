Tic Tac Toe
=====================

Project Description
----------------------

This was my first time trying to solve some problems using code. 

As a General Assembly student, this project required building this code from scratch, and it was very challenging to put into practice what I had learned so far about HTML, CSS and JS (using jQuery).

In the time frame, I achieved all the project requirements and I made a bonus part to keeping track of multiples rounds with a win counter in the time frame. And also a ***EASTER EGG***, try to find it.
